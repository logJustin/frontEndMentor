# Frontend Mentor

I've taken up various projects and challenges to push my boundaries and stay up to date with the latest trends in front-end development. One of the valuable resources I've used along the way is Frontend Mentor. It has been instrumental in sharpening my skills and expanding my horizons in UI/UX design and coding. ðŸ’ª

To demonstrate my progress and highlight the projects I've worked on, I've organized them into separate folders. Each project showcases my ability to bring a designer's vision to life by building out the functionality from scratch. Here are a few examples:
