### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Chart.js
- Bootstrap
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- RESTful API


### What I learned

- Using a prior known software like Chart.JS was mostly a good idea. It assisted in building my chart in a responsive format.
- However, re-stylizing to meet a specific look was about 60% of the project.


### Useful resources

- [Chart.JS](https://www.chartjs.org/) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
